#### Overview:
AI development, while transformative, is accelerating environmental damage due to the energy demands of training and running large models. The faster we move toward solutions that emphasize preferred models—systems that learn user familiarity and deliver more efficient, tailored responses—the sooner we can reduce waste and make AI more sustainable for the world.
#### App Idea:
One concept I’d like to build is a utility SMS messaging app that enables communication across multiple proprietary AI models. Instead of relying on cluttered interfaces with side navigations, chat histories, or extra utilities, the app would simplify interaction by letting users text AI models from providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google directly.
Functioning like a router switch, the app would connect to these different AI models through a single number and webhook, allowing the user to seamlessly select and switch between models. The result is a lightweight, streamlined way to engage with multiple AI systems without unnecessary overhead.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- Swift’s two-phase initialization rule
- Direct reference of subview elements in subview items.
